<h2>Donegal Minors ease past Fermanagh in first championship game.</h2>
<p>Donegal minors were too good for Fermanagh as they made their way into the Ulster Minor Football Championship semi-final. Daithi Gildea was the leading marksman for Donegal, scoring 2-3 from play, while also notching three frees. Lorcan McGee and Kevin Lynch bagged a goal each with Mark McDevitt scoring 0-3 and Finbar Roarty getting two points. Sean McLaughlin, Karl Joseph Molloy (f), Sean Martin and Cian McMenamin (45) all got a point each for Luke Barrettâ€™s side. </p>
<h3>Donegal: Zach Conlon; Shaun McMenamin, Niall Prenderville, Donal Gallagher; Finbar Roarty, Eoghan Kelly, Sean Martin; Cian McMenamin, Lorcan McGee; Karl Joseph Molloy, Conor McGinty, Sean McLaughlin; Mark McDevitt, Daithi Gildea, Ryan Barrett. Subs: Padraig Coyle for Barrett, Odhran Doherty for C McMenamin, Cian McGee for S McLaughlin, Kevin Lynch for Gildea, Eoghan Scott for Roarty </h3>
